Desciption:

The desired program should be able to dynamically create subnets, which can also be divided as often as desired. The network ID, first host, last host, broadcast and the CIDR notation are output for each network. For the calculation an IP in the subnet and the CIDR notation is entered. The GUI should display the subnets in tabular form and has a button to calculate the subnet as well as a button to split the individual subnets. Also planned is a button that reloads the page completely, without previous values. 
In summary the following features should be supported:
- Subnet calculation
- subnet sharing
- Subnet merging
- Tabular display
- Button for completely reloading the page
- Buttons for subnet calculation and division
